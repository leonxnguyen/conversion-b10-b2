# Introduction

## About
Created for a course I'm teaching titled ("Mathematics for Computer Science"). Made solely by me with no assistance nor research (only for the algorithms and whatnot though; for the GUI stuff, I had to look stuff up haha).

I've designed it to convert specific characters that I've assigned a specific base-10 value with its base-2 equivalent (key is located at the bottom).

With slight modifications, it's capable of converting any number from base-10 to base-2 and vice-versa.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Tkinter

MacOS: Run `brew install python-tk`

Linux: it should be available via your package managerâ€”I believe the command for installation will vary based on you Linux distro (and package manager).

3. Run `binary_to_char.py` (couldn't think of a good name, sorry ðŸ˜ž)

## To Add
1. Option to create your own key!
2. Character limit and moving excess text to another line.
